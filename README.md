## Feedback
You can use the [AntennaPod Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/antennapod) for discussions about the app.

Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted [here](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues) (please read the [instructions](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to report a bug and how to submit a feature request first!).

## Help test AntennaPod
AntennaPod has many users and we don't want them to run into trouble when we add a new feature. It's important that we have a significant group test our app, so that we know all possible combinations of phones, Android versions and use cases work as expected. Check out our wiki how to join our [Alpha and Beta testing programmes](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Help-test-AntennaPod)!
