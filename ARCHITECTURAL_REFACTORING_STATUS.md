## What Needs to be Done: Implementation Phase

### Issue 1: DBWriter Integration (8-10 hours) - CRITICAL BLOCKING
**Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**What**: Move 9 async queue operations from QueueRepositoryImpl's custom ExecutorService to DBWriter's shared executor

**Operations to move**:
1. createQueue()
2. updateQueue()
3. deleteQueue()
4. switchActiveQueue()
5. addEpisodeToQueue()
6. removeEpisodeFromQueue()
7. reorderQueueEpisodes()
8. clearQueue()
9. moveEpisodeBetweenQueues()

**Steps**: 6 major steps documented in ISSUE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Add methods to DBWriter (3-4 hrs)
- Delegate from QueueRepositoryImpl (2-3 hrs)
- Test and verify (1-2 hrs)

**Blocking**: All other architectural work and Phase 5

---

### Issue 2: Queue Model Refactoring (7-8 hours) - CRITICAL BLOCKING
**Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**What**: Make Queue.isDefault and Queue.isActive read-only, enforce uniqueness in repository

**Changes**:
- Remove setDefault() and setActive() methods from Queue
- Update QueueRepositoryImpl to manage state changes
- Ensure only one queue is default and only one is active

**Risk**: Medium (affects core model)
**Testing**: All 23 queue unit tests must pass

**Blocking**: Phase 5 implementation

---

### Issue 3: ViewBinding Integration (4-5 hours) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**Files affected**:
1. QueueColorPicker.java
2. QueueIconPicker.java
3. QueueSwitchBottomSheet.java

**Changes**: Replace findViewById() with ViewBinding in all 3 files

---

### Issue 4: Exception Cleanup (5-6 hours) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**Actions**:
1. Remove DefaultQueueException (move logic to UI/ViewModel)
2. Review QueueNameExistsException (validation vs exception)
3. Keep QueueNotFoundException (reasonable exception)

---

### Issue 5: Event Consolidation (4 hours) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**Actions**:
1. Remove QueueContentChangedEvent
2. Use QueueEvent exclusively
3. Update QueueRepositoryImpl to post QueueEvent

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (16-18 hours)
1. Issue 1: DBWriter integration (8-10 hrs) - BLOCKING
2. Issue 2: Queue model refactoring (7-8 hrs) - BLOCKING

**Milestone**: Core architecture fixed, all tests passing

### Phase 2: Pattern Fixes (8-9 hours)
3. Issue 3: ViewBinding (4-5 hrs) - Code consistency
4. Issue 5: Event consolidation (4 hrs) - Pattern alignment

**Milestone**: UI and communication patterns aligned

### Phase 3: Cleanup (5-6 hours)
5. Issue 4: Exception cleanup (5-6 hrs) - Design refinement

**Milestone**: Exception hierarchy simplified

### Phase 4: Validation
- All unit tests pass
- Code review by maintainer
- No regressions
- Documentation updated

---

## Success Criteria

All of the following must be true:

✅ **Issue 1**: QueueRepositoryImpl has no ExecutorService, all 9 operations delegate to DBWriter
✅ **Issue 2**: Queue.isDefault/isActive are read-only, uniqueness enforced in repository
✅ **Issue 3**: All 3 UI components use ViewBinding
✅ **Issue 4**: Unnecessary exceptions removed
✅ **Issue 5**: Only QueueEvent used for queue-related events
✅ **Tests**: All 33 queue unit tests pass
✅ **Build**: No compile errors, checkstyle passes
✅ **Review**: PR approved by ByteHamster

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This session)
- ✅ Create comprehensive plans - DONE
- ✅ Document all 5 issues - DONE
- ✅ Create implementation guides - DONE
- Mark tasks as complete in todo list

### Short term (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. Implement Issue 1 (DBWriter integration) - CRITICAL
2. Implement Issue 2 (Queue model refactoring) - CRITICAL
3. Run full test suite and verify no regressions
4. Commit and request code review

### Medium term (Week 4)
5. Implement Issues 3-5 (ViewBinding, events, exceptions)
6. Final testing and validation
7. Submit refactored code for review

### Long term (After review approval)
8. Proceed with Phase 5 implementation
9. Add remaining user story features

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Threading issues in Issue 1 | HIGH | Multiple test runs, monitor on real device |
| Data sync issues in Issue 2 | HIGH | Comprehensive testing, database integrity checks |
| Breaking ViewBinding changes | MEDIUM | Test UI updates, verify on multiple screen sizes |
| Event handling changes | MEDIUM | Verify EventBus subscribers still work |
| Exception handling changes | LOW | Comprehensive error scenario testing |
