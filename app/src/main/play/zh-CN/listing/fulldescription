AntennaPod 是播客管理和播放工具，使得你即刻收听到数百万来自从个人播客制作者到类似BBC、NPR和CNN等大型出版机构的免费或付费播客。通过 iTunes 数据库、OPML 文件或简单的 RSS 地址，你可以自由地添加、导入和导出播客订阅流。通过指定次数、间隔时间和 WIFI 网络的下载以及基于个人喜好和延迟删除的设置，功能强大的智能控制做到了省力、省电和省流量。<br>
但最重要的在于，你可以选择下载、串流或加入队列等方式收听节目，并使用调节回放速度、章节跳转和定时睡眠的辅助功能。你甚至可以通过 Flattr 集成功能向内容创作者表达你衷心的感谢。

AntennaPod 是一个由播客爱好者开发，在多种意义下“自由”的软件——开源、免费并且没有广告。
