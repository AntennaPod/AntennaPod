## Help test AntennaPod
AntennaPod has many users and we don't want them to run into trouble when we add a new feature. It's important that we have a significant group test our app, so that we know all possible combinations of phones, Android versions and use cases work as expected. Check out our wiki how to join our [Alpha and Beta testing programmes](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Help-test-AntennaPod)!
