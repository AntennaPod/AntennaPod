## Feedback
You can use the [AntennaPod Forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/) for discussions about the app or just podcasting in general.

Bug reports and feature requests can be submitted [here](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues) (please read the [instructions](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to report a bug and how to submit a feature request first!).

## Help to test AntennaPod
AntennaPod has many users and we don't want them to run into trouble when we add a new feature. It's important that we have a significant group test our app, so that we know all possible combinations of phones, Android versions and use cases work as expected. Check out our wiki on how to join our [Alpha and Beta testing programmes](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Help-test-AntennaPod)!
